GitGraph - A git-backed graph database
======================================

This is an experimental project with idea taken from the `hexastore
<http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/1/1453965.pdf>`_ paper.

Basic Axioms:
-------------

Every *subject name* is a root tree in the repository.
Every *object* is stored as a git blob, but has a unique uuid which can be accessed through a special index.
Every *indexed* **predicate** is a sub-tree containing blobs whose name in the tree is the blob_id of the original object, its value is the indexed value itself.
Objects are stored in the tree under the path: ``SubjectName/objects/:blob_id``
The blob-id of an **Object** can be retrieved at ``SubjectName/_ids/:uuid4``
The *uuid4* of an **Object** can be retrieved at ``SubjectName/_uuids/:blob_id``
Indexed predicates are stored in the tree with the path: ``SubjectName/indexes/<index name>/:blob_id``

Supported Operations
--------------------

- Create/Merge subjects by ``uuid4``
- Retrieve subjects by ``uuid4``
- Retrieve subjects by ``blob_id``
- Retrieve subjects by *indexed predicates*
- Delete nodes with all their references


TODO:
-----

- Support directed relationships
- Support querying by relationships
- Support GraphQL *(graphene-python ?)*
- Concurrent ZeroMQ server request/reply
- Replication through git-push
- Merge strategies *(git flow?)*
- Use git-hooks for real time notifications
